"""Regression tests ensuring data endpoints do not block the event loop.

Every data-heavy route performs synchronous, blocking pandas file I/O
(``read_table_safe`` / ``save_table_safe``) and CPU-bound work. In Starlette a
path operation declared ``async def`` runs directly on the asyncio event loop,
so any blocking call inside it stalls the whole loop and serializes otherwise
concurrent requests. FastAPI instead runs plain ``def`` path operations in an
external threadpool, keeping the loop free.

These tests pin that contract two ways:

1. Structurally: the blocking routes are plain ``def`` (not coroutines), and the
   one route that must stay ``async def`` (``upload_project`` awaits validation)
   offloads its blocking work via ``run_in_threadpool``.
2. Behaviourally: overlapping requests to a route whose read is made slow do not
   serialize, proving the event loop is not blocked while the read runs.
